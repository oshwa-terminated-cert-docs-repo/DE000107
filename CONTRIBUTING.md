# How to contribute

Hello! Thanks for reading this, and for considering contributing to this
project documentation. All that you contribute will fall under [the licenses we
use](LICENSE), so please go ahead and check out if that is okay with you
beforehand. With that out of the way, let's move on.

### What contributions do you accept?
Generally speaking, we accept any and all contributions that add value to the
repository. From experience, they usually do add value.

What we're mostly looking for, since those things are what we believe helps the
most for the users:

- bug fixes / corrections for [the
    wiki](https://github.com/bmc-labs/board_mini/wiki)
- additional examples for the boards
- fixes or additions to the existing examples

### In what form would you like the contribution?
Please fork the repo, add your contribution and submit a Merge/Pull Request. If
your contribution has been discussed beforehand in an issue, kindly reference
the issue.

### Any other requests?
Be polite. That's it.

### Is there a code of conduct?
We did non invent our own popular ones. However we do like [the Rust Code of
Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct) and implement it
verbatim. The moderation contact is simply
[info@bmc-labs.com](mailto:info@bmc-labs.com).
